## [A1_arima.R](https://github.com/nathaliemayor/Time_Series_Econometrics/blob/main/A1_arima.R) - *Time Series Modelling, Robust ACF Confidence Bands, Robust Portmanteau Estimators* [[1]](#1)

1. Computing sample ACF and PACF with classical confidance bands. Based, on the results, selection of an *ARMA(p,q)* process.
2. Implementation of the robust ACF conficence bands and the robust Portmanteau estimators.
3. Applying the robust portmanteau tests to a time series with time-varying variance. Building ACF plots with robust confidence bands.
